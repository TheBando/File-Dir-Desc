One of my assignments from OS  
its pretty straightforward to use:
./a6                            (for working dir)
./a6 FILENAME FILENAME FILENAME (for however many)
(Assuming you dont alter the name in the makefile)

Prints out:

FILENAME:
FILE TYPE:
PERMISSIONS:
OWNER_NAME:
GROUP_NAME:
DATE_OF_LAST_MODIFICATION:
LINK_COUNT:
INODE_NUMBER:
